# Conference Buddy 2.0.

✨ this is a work-in-progress project ✨

## Background about the project

Conference Buddy aims to a platform to find companions for tech conferences if you're uncomfortable going on your own - or if you want to support someone who feels that way!

You can look for one or more person with whom you can attend a conference together. Support each other, find a familiar face between all these strangers. You will feel more at ease and comfortable just knowing you’re not alone.

At the same time, you have the opportunity to help others to feel better! Let’s make tech events more approachable - one Buddy at a time.
